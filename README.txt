This project Cyber Management as a whole looks forward in integrating all types of database management systems into one. Thereby, eliminating the need for individual code for performing tasks like hotel management, library management etc.. By doing so, clients can create their own database systems according to his/her requirement.Â 
The implementation is done through file handling. This is done by creating unique text file for records for different users. As a result, data is efficiently maintained with utmost security, all redundancies and errors can be addressed as well.
